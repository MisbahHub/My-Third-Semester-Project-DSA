# Spotify Songs Tracker

A Java-based DSA project that simulates a Spotify-like songs tracker using core data structures.  
This project demonstrates how Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search, and Sorting algorithms can be applied to solve real-world problems such as:

- Creating and managing a playlist  
- Searching for songs efficiently  
- Tracking recently played songs  
- Managing upcoming songs  
- Ranking songs by number of streams  


## 🚀 Features

### **1. Playlist Management (Linked List)**
- Add or remove tracks dynamically  
- Display the playlist with song names and stream counts  
- Songs are stored as nodes in a Singly Linked List  

### **2. Song Search (Binary Search)**
- Search for a song by its name in **O(log n)** time  
- Works on a **sorted** playlist  
- Case-insensitive search  

### **3. Recently Played Songs (Stack)**
- Tracks the last 5 played songs  
- Uses **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle  
- Automatically removes oldest entry when limit exceeds  

### **4. Upcoming Songs (Queue)**
- Stores songs that are “next to play”  
- Uses **FIFO (First In, First Out)**  
- Add new songs to the queue and play them in correct order  

### **5. Top Streamed Songs (Sorting)**
- Sorts songs by number of streams  
- Displays **Top 10** most-streamed songs in descending order  
- Implemented using **Bubble Sort**  


## 📂 CSV Data File

The program reads data from:

**`Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024.csv`**

Example columns:

| Song Name        | Artist       | Album        | Release Date | Streams        |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Shape of You     | Ed Sheeran   | ÷ (Divide)   | 2017         | 3,752,489,239  |
| Blinding Lights  | The Weeknd   | After Hours  | 2020         | 3,483,495,720  |

**Only _Song Name_ and _Streams_ columns are used in this project.**


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The CSV file is read line by line  
2. Song name + stream count extracted  
3. Commas removed from numbers (e.g., 1,234,567 → 1234567)  
4. Songs added to Linked List playlist  
5. Playlist converted into an array for:  
   - Alphabetical sorting  
   - Binary Search  
6. Top 10 songs sorted by stream count  
7. Recently played songs tracked using Stack  
8. Upcoming songs stored in Queue  


## 🧰 Data Structures Used

- **Linked List** → Playlist  
- **Stack** → Recently played history  
- **Queue** → Upcoming songs  
- **Binary Search** → Efficient song search  
- **Bubble Sort** → Sorting songs by name and stream count  


## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created as part of my **Third Semester DSA Course Project** to demonstrate the use of fundamental data structures in a real-world scenario.
